# TI Studio

This is a website for a cozy music home studio.<br>
It is only one-page project, but that's pretty enough so far.<br>
A user can freely navigate through the page using only the keyboard.<br>
The website is endlessly scalable and at the same time very lightweight - <br>
as it is built wholly on the SVG graphics.

Designer and developer: @healdementia
