# TI Studio

This is a web-site for a cozy music home studio.
It is only one-page project, but that's pretty enough so far.
A user can freely navigate through the page using only the keyboard.
The page is endlessly scalable and at the same time very lightweight - as it is built wholly on the SVG graphics.

Designer and developer: @healdementia
